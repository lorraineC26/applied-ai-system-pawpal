# Project Requirements

## 1. Functionality: What Your System Should Do

Your project should **do something useful with AI**. For example:

- Summarize text or documents
- Retrieve information or data from a source
- Plan and complete a step-by-step task
- Help debug, classify, or explain something

To make your project more advanced, it must include **at least one** of the following AI features:

| Feature | What It Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Your AI looks up or retrieves information before answering. | A study bot that searches notes before generating a quiz question. |
| **Agentic Workflow** | Your AI can plan, act, and check its own work. | A coding assistant that writes, tests, and then fixes code automatically. |
| **Fine-Tuned or Specialized Model** | You use a model that's been trained or adjusted for a specific task. | A chatbot tuned to respond in a company's tone of voice. |
| **Reliability or Testing System** | You include ways to measure or test how well your AI performs. | A script that checks if your AI gives consistent answers. |

The feature should be fully integrated into the main application logic. It is not enough to have a standalone script; the feature must meaningfully change how the system behaves or processes information. For example, if you add RAG, your AI should actively use the retrieved data to formulate its response rather than just printing the data alongside a standard answer.

Also, make sure your project:

- **Runs correctly and reproducibly:** If someone follows your instructions, it should work.
- **Includes logging or guardrails:** Your code should track what it does and handle errors safely.
- **Has clear setup steps:** Someone else should be able to run it without guessing what to install.

## 2. Design and Architecture: How Your System Fits Together

Show how your project is organized by creating a short system diagram. Your diagram should include:

- The main components (like retriever, agent, evaluator, or tester).
- How data flows through the system (input → process → output).
- Where humans or testing are involved in checking AI results.

## 3. Documentation: How You Explain Your Work

You'll write a README file that clearly explains your project. It should include:

- Explicitly name your original project (from Modules 1-3) and provide a 2-3 sentence summary of its original goals and capabilities.
- **Title and Summary:** What your project does and why it matters.
- **Architecture Overview:** A short explanation of your system diagram.
- **Setup Instructions:** Step-by-step directions to run your code.
- **Sample Interactions:** Include at least 2-3 examples of inputs and the resulting AI outputs to demonstrate the system is functional.
- **Design Decisions:** Why you built it this way, and what trade-offs you made.
- **Testing Summary:** What worked, what didn't, and what you learned.
- **Reflection:** What this project taught you about AI and problem-solving.

> Write this for a future employer who might look at your GitHub portfolio! Clarity and completeness matter more than perfection.

## 4. Reliability and Evaluation: How You Test and Improve Your AI

Your AI should prove that it works, not just seem like it does. Include at least one way to test or measure its reliability, such as:

- Automated tests (e.g., unit tests or simple checks for key functions).
- Confidence scoring (the AI rates how sure it is).
- Logging and error handling (your code records what failed and why).
- Human evaluation (you or a peer review the AI's output).

Summarize your testing in a few lines, like:

- *5 out of 6 tests passed; the AI struggled when context was missing.*
- *Confidence scores averaged 0.8; accuracy improved after adding validation rules.*

## 5. Reflection and Ethics: Thinking Critically About Your AI

AI isn't just about what works -- it's about what's responsible. Include a short reflection answering the following questions:

- What are the limitations or biases in your system?
- Could your AI be misused, and how would you prevent that?
- What surprised you while testing your AI's reliability?
- Describe your collaboration with AI during this project. Identify one instance when the AI gave a helpful suggestion and one instance where its suggestion was flawed or incorrect.

## 6. Presentation and Portfolio: Sharing Your Work Professionally
 
You'll wrap up by sharing your final project.
 
- Prepare a **5-7 minute presentation** showing your system, demo, and what you learned.
- Add a **portfolio artifact:**
  - A GitHub link to your code
  - A short reflection paragraph: What this project says about me as an AI engineer.
- **Record a Loom video walkthrough (required):** Create a short walkthrough showing your system running end-to-end. To record, we recommend using Loom. Include the link in your README.
**[IMPORTANT]** To receive an accurate grade, please make sure your video walkthrough clearly demonstrates the following features:
 
- ✅ End-to-end system run (2-3 inputs)
- ✅ AI feature behavior (RAG, agent, etc.)
- ✅ Reliability/guardrail or evaluation behavior
- ✅ Clear outputs for each case
> It does not need to show code setup, file structure, or installation steps. If you are unsure about including something in your video, consult the Grading Rubric.
